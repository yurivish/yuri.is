about = "Taken in a park in Boston. Note that I have no zoom... I managed to get incredibly close."
critique = "The sky at the top is an ugly color in the edited version, and the quality of the bokeh is a bit ugly. I don't know whether that's the camera, or if I can do something about it. Even closer cropping might be best."
