Here's a quick post about me -- I noticed today that my [cards](http://yuri.is/cardcrafting) and site have little information on that subject.

My background is in computer science, linguistics, and design, and my love is building tools for creativity and understanding. This includes artistic tools that bridge the gap between ability and taste, and user interfaces for exploring data and ideas.

My most recent project is [Silk 2 for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/silk-2-interactive-generative/id1050339928?mt=8), a new take on the [original](http://weavesilk.com). Over 25 million people have played with the site, and the app was recently featured on the front page of the App Store. 

Silk has also been on exhibit for several years in the [Children's Creativity Museum](http://creativity.org) in San Francisco.

It's been interesting to see the art that people create. Most enjoy making pieces with lots of symmetry.

But in the hands of an artist something remarkable happens...

<img src='{{< relpath "1.jpg" >}}' srcset='{{< relpath "1.jpg" >}} 1000w, {{< relpath "2x/1.jpg" >}} 2000w'  />

<img src='{{< relpath "2.jpg" >}}' srcset='{{< relpath "2.jpg" >}} 1000w, {{< relpath "2x/2.jpg" >}} 2000w'  />

_Art notes --_ The pictures of the eye and person were drawn by [Daniel Coonfield](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-coonfield-77624937), and the others are by [Oliver Wetter](http://www.fantasio.info/).
