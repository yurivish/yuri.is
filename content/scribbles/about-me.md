Today while at a picnic I realized that this site has no information about me. Here's a first pass, to be condensed later.

My background is in computer science, linguistics, and design, and my love is building tools for creativity and understanding. 

Right now I'm working on artistic tools that bridge the gap between ability and taste and on creating better user interfaces for exploring information.

My most recent project is [Silk 2 for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/silk-2-interactive-generative/id1050339928?mt=8), a new take on the [original](http://weavesilk.com). Over 25 million people have played with the site, and the app was featured on the front page of the App Store. 

Silk has also been on exhibit for several years in the [Children's Creativity Museum](http://creativity.org) in San Francisco.

Most people using Silk enjoy making pieces with lots of symmetry...

But in the hands of an artist something remarkable happens. These were made by professional artists playing with Silk for the first time.

<img src='{{< relpath "1.jpg" >}}' srcset='{{< relpath "1.jpg" >}} 1000w, {{< relpath "2x/1.jpg" >}} 2000w'  />

<img src='{{< relpath "2.jpg" >}}' srcset='{{< relpath "2.jpg" >}} 1000w, {{< relpath "2x/2.jpg" >}} 2000w'  />

<img src='{{< relpath "Angelic%20creature-oliver-wetter.jpg" >}}' srcset='{{< relpath "Angelic%20creature-oliver-wetter.jpg" >}} 1000w, {{< relpath "2x/Angelic%20creature-oliver-wetter.jpg" >}} 2000w'  />

Another recent project of mine is a series of fine art prints that double as business cards. I wrote an essay on the [process behind creating and printing them](http://yuri.is/cardcrafting).

_Art notes --_ The pictures of the eye and person were drawn by [Daniel Coonfield](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-coonfield-77624937). The other Silk art was drawn by [Oliver Wetter](http://www.fantasio.info/).
