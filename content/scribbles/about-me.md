_August 15:_ I decided that this site needs an about page. This is a first pass.

I build tools for creativity and understanding. My background is in computer science, linguistics, and design.

My most recent project is [Silk 2 for iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/silk-2-interactive-generative/id1050339928?mt=8), an artistic tool that helps bridge the gap between ability and taste.

Over 25 million people have played with the [original site](http://weavesilk.com), and it's been exhibited in the [Children's Creativity Museum](http://creativity.org) in San Francisco.

Most people enjoy making pieces with lots of symmetry:

<img src='{{< relpath "0x0ss-5.jpg" >}}' srcset='{{< relpath "0x0ss-5.jpg" >}} 1000w, {{< relpath "2x/0x0ss-5.jpg" >}} 2000w'  />

But in the hands of an artist something remarkable happens. These were made by professional artists playing with Silk for the first time.

<img src='{{< relpath "1.jpg" >}}' srcset='{{< relpath "1.jpg" >}} 1000w, {{< relpath "2x/1.jpg" >}} 2000w'  />

<img src='{{< relpath "2.jpg" >}}' srcset='{{< relpath "2.jpg" >}} 1000w, {{< relpath "2x/2.jpg" >}} 2000w'  />

<img src='{{< relpath "Angelic%20creature-oliver-wetter.jpg" >}}' srcset='{{< relpath "Angelic%20creature-oliver-wetter.jpg" >}} 1000w, {{< relpath "2x/Angelic%20creature-oliver-wetter.jpg" >}} 2000w'  />

Another fun project was a series of fine art prints that double as business cards. I wrote an essay on the [process behind creating and printing them](http://yuri.is/cardcrafting).

_Art notes --_ The pictures of the eye and person were drawn by [Daniel Coonfield](https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-coonfield-77624937). The other Silk art was drawn by [Oliver Wetter](http://www.fantasio.info/). The colors in the piece above are from a [painting of water lilies](http://yuri.is/cardcrafting/img_2x/water_lilies_monet.jpg) by Claude Monet.
