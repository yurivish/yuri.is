# The Artists of Magic

I've been playing around with data on [Magic
](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) provided by [mtg json](http://mtgjson.com/). Nothing particularly exciting yet, but here are some [sparklines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline) of the most prolific Magic artists. 

The charts show each artist's cumulative contributions over time.
