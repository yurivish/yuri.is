# Magic Artists

The game of [Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) is now over 20 years old.

There's a lot of history to explore, and ever since I found a [website](http://mtgjson.com/) offering all of the set and card data in an easy-to-use format I've been having a look around.

By the numbers, the most prolific Magic artist of all time is [Kev Walker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kev_Walker), with 429 paintings starting from [Mirage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirage_(Magic:_The_Gathering)) in 1996.
