By the numbers, the most prolific [Magic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering) card artist of all time is [Kev Walker](http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Search/Default.aspx?action=advanced&artist=%5B%22Kev%20Walker%22%5D), with 429 paintings since 1996. The game is now over 20 years old, so this is a pretty impressive feat.
