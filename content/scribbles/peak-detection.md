Sometimes you want to find the peaks in a time series. Here's a simple but effective approach that I used on a [recent project](http://rhythm-of-food.net).

_chart with peaks identified_

The basic idea is to give each sample a spikiness score based on local context and then use it to pick out the globally strongest peaks.

_data => scores => thresholding_

First, we score each sample by comparing it to its shortest neighbors on each side. The bigger the difference, the higher the score.

Next, we normalize the scores to a common baseline. A good choice is `(score - mean(scores)) / stdev(scores)`, which normalizes scale but preserves outliers.

_show the chart along with scores for each sample_

Now we can use a sensitivity threshold to pick our peaks, keeping samples with scores above the threshold and discarding the rest.

There's a small problem -- peaks spanning multiple samples appear multiple times. To fix this, we coalesce peaks that are close together.

The first step is to score each sample based on its local spikiness by comparing it to its nearby neighbors on the left and the right.

<!-- A high _threshold_ keeps only the strongest peaks, while lowering the threshold starts to let in smaller peaks with lower scores. -->

<!-- 
So far the scores are in the same units as our original data, so the next step is to rescale them.  -->
<!-- Normalizing them  will allow us to consistently treat different time series. A good choice is `(score - mean(scores)) / stdev(scores)`, which normalizes scale but preserves outliers. -->

<!-- the same cutoff for different time series. -->
