potential posts
	- outline how my site works. i'll thank myself later...
		- deploy to netlify via drag-and-drop (y.netlify.com)
		- nameservers set on isnic point to cloudflare
		- build_assets.py script builds assets, which are stored in a separate repository
			- copies photos over and resizes them
			- copies over cardcrafting
		- posts set script = true or style = true in order to load a custom css or js
		- style.css and script.js are stored in a folder with the name of the post inside the content folder, and are therefore copied over verbatim.
		- each script encapsulates itself in a function and passes in the slug for the post to give a semblance of namespacing
		- we write in typescript and compile down to javascript
			- we store both in version control because the cost is low and it makes it future-proof for later -- even without a typescript compiler we can clone & deploy
				- though this does mean that script.ts and script.js may get out of date
				- what happens when d3.min.js gets update and old posts break? dependencies not isolated...
		- posts are numbered via `seq` in the frontmatter
		- NOTE: enforce trailing slashes! svg gradient fills fail otherwise: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15123953/svg-fill-url-behaving-strangely-in-firefox
			- we do this by enabling 'pretty urls' in netlify postprocessing.
