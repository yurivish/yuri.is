<h1>Mini Portfolio: Yuri Vishnesky</h1>

<p>Hello!</p>

<p>I don't have a portfolio on my <a href="http://yuri.is">website</a> at the moment, so I put together this quick tour through four of my recent projects.</p>


<h2>1. Silk</h2>

<p><a href="http://weavesilk.com">Silk</a> is a painting program that enables anyone in the world to make beautiful art.</p>

<p><strong>Favorite quote:</strong> &quot;This is far too soothing. If Genghis Khan had had access to that, the Mongols would have stayed home.&quot;</p>

<p>The new <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/silk-2-interactive-generative-art/id1050339928?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Silk 2</a> app for iOS is the best take on Silk's ideas so far.</p>

<h3>Specific interesting contributions</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Responsible for all design and implementation. Silk is my perennial toy project – it's a design sandbox where I get to explore the limits of user interface design and dynamic interaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Over 25,000,000 people have played with the website. Artists use it for creative inspiration, teachers use it to teach symmetry.</p></li>
<li><p>On exhibit in the Children’s Creativity Museum in San Francisco for several years.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Featured twice by Apple on the front page of the App Store, and selected by Apple for a national cross-promotion in Sephora stores.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>The (several-years-old) <a href="http://weavesilk.com">website</a> is Coffeescript + Canvas. The color picker (blue circle; top left) uses d3 for the color blending interface — try dragging from one color to another.</li>
<li>The new <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/silk-2-interactive-generative-art/id1050339928?mt=8&amp;ign-mpt=uo%3D4">Silk 2 app</a> is Swift 3 + Metal.</li>

<h2>2. Business Cards</h2>

<p>I decided to make myself some beautiful business cards. The project quickly blossomed to <a href="http://yuri.is/cardcrafting">ridiculous proportions</a> and I ended up making 600 individually unique letterpressed fine art prints. Totally worth it. :-)</p>

</a></figure>

<h3>Specific interesting contributions</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Designed a <a href="http://yuri.is/cardcrafting">walkthrough article</a> for the project, including live-replays of the generative algorithm so that you can see how the final structure emerges from the individually placed pixels.</p></li>
<li><p>Implemented a <a href="http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/22144/images-with-all-colors">cool pixel-placing algorithm</a> in <a href="http://julialang.org">Julia</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Published an <a href="https://github.com/yurivish/LowDimNearestNeighbors.jl">open-source package</a> that implements a a nearest-neighbor search algorithm by generalizing binary search.</p></li>
<li><p>Published an <a href="https://github.com/yurivish/Treaps.jl">open-source package</a> that implements a treap, a funny-named data structure that is both a tree and a heap.</p></li>
<li><p>Shared my experiences making art with a programming language designed for technical computing at the first-ever <a href="http://juliacon.org">Julia conference</a> in Chicago.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://julialang.org">Julia</a> for the core algorithm and asset production pipeline.</li>
<li>D3 for the art generation playback engine in the <a href="http://yuri.is/cardcrafting">story post</a>.</li>
<li>An early alpha version of <a href="http://figma.com">Figma</a> for exploring card designs and designing the story post.</li>
</ul>

<h2>3. Luminoso</h2>

<p>I was an early employee at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminoso">Luminoso</a>, a text analytics startup spun out of the <a href="http://media.mit.edu">MIT Media Lab</a> where I was responsible for designing and developing Luminoso's main product, the Luminoso Dashboard.</p>

<p>The Dashboard is a web-based environment that enables users to analyze and explore their data to find stories that solve real-world problems.</p>

<p>For example, we helped many companies make decisions about product development based on large amounts of customer feedback.</p>

<h3>Specific interesting contributions</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Developed novel visualizations to help decision-making by using Luminoso's vector-based text understanding technology. Became a better designer through years of focused experimentation and user feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>One specific visualization that I'm proud of is the Concept Cloud, a new take on word clouds. It's a seriously cool visualization that makes word clouds <em>mean something</em> — position, size, and color all matter and give you affordances to further explore the relationships between concepts.</p></li>
<li><p>Collaborated with internal analysts to help find insights in client data and to make user-driven changes to the dashboard.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not generally a fan of software patents, but it seems worth mentioning that I'm on one for the Concept Cloud: <a href="http://www.google.ch/patents/US20140282244">Word cloud rotatable through N dimensions via user interface</a>. </p></li>
<li><p>As a fun side project, I made a <a href="http://luminoso.com/colors/">visualization</a> of the <a href="https://blog.xkcd.com/2010/05/03/color-survey-results/">xkcd color survey</a> using Luminoso technology to find the most positive, negative, and food-related colors.</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>React for general page structure and D3 for core visualizations.</li>
<li>Webpack and Jasmine for builds and testing.</li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Google Rhythm of Food</h2>

<p>Working together with <a href="http://truth-and-beauty.net">Moritz Stefaner</a>, I helped create a <a href="http://rhythm-of-food.net/">website</a> exploring seasonal food patterns in Google searches. I was responsible for a large part of the development, as well as some parts of the design.</p>

<figure>

<p>I joined the project in the second half of the prototyping phase, helped define the visualization and scope, and was involved in all aspects of the design and development of the final product.</p>

<h3>Specific interesting contributions</h3>

<ul>
<li><p>Built a hybrid Canvas/SVG renderer to handle the increasing performance requirements of rendering an interactive responsive site showing 135,025 individual data points.</p></li>
<li><p>Built a simple annotation helper to assist the person responsible for text and annotation in annotating specific points on the various charts by pointing and clicking.</p></li>
<li><p>Researched and implemented a peak detection algorithm to identify foods with strong seasonal peaks around holidays. This was used to label the relevant holidays for each food — for example, here's <a href="http://rhythm-of-food.net/apple-cider">Apple Cider</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Built an animation pipeline to export animation frames that can be made into a .gif for sharing food animations on social media. The same animations can be run live on the site — for example, here's the page for <a href="http://rhythm-of-food.net/asparagus">Asparagus</a>. Click &quot;Play!&quot; in the lower-right-hand corner.</p></li>
<li><p>Came up with the &quot;Charts that look like the food&quot; category in the explore section. :-)</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>Tools</h3>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li>Mathematica for data science and peak detection prototyping.</li>
<li>React components to build the site, D3 for the core of the visualizations, and mobx to bind them.</li>
</ul>
